Description:
    The relation generator creates relationships for a new model

    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name
    may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be
    suffixed with anything.

    As additional parameters, the generator will take attribute pairs
    described by name and type.

Examples:
    hobo generate relation client hm:projects bt:user

    This will add the following lines to app/models/client.rb:

      has_many :projects
      belongs_to :user

    Additionally, it will also add "user" to the "attr_accessible" list
